Domestic Violence Risk Assessment App (DVRAA) Introduction:
Every woman needs to be able to identify a high risk partners!
Imagine walking through a jungle, and no one has ever taught you which plants are safe to eat, or what a snake looks like, or that tigers bite.
Dangerous? Absolutely!
That’s what it’s like for any woman walking through the dating jungle today.
Some men are nice and some are not, but she’s never really been taught how to tell the difference between a “Creep” and someone she could call her “Life Partner”.
Some women get lucky, and find their Prince Charming on their own. 
Sadly, too many womenfind out too late that they’ve being dating a poisonous toad.
Some “Creeps” know how to fake being a decent human being, but if you know what to look for, it’s possible to see through their disguise.

That’s where the Domestic Violence Risk Assessment App comes in.

It’s your guide on what to look for in a man, so that you don’t get stuck with an abusive partner.
At their worst, an abusive partner can ruin lives, and even assault or murder their partners that they claim to love.
The DVRAA questionnaire was written by a Canadian Police Detective with decades of experience dealing with high conflict families and abusive relationships.
The Detective learned that good men were distinguishable from the “Creeps” that mistreat and abuse their wives and girlfriends, if you knew what to look for.
He also recognized that many women had never been taught this skill, and could benefit from his ability to identify “Creeps”.
The DVRAA  isn’t just for you! Please share it with your friends, sisters or any woman you know who is involved in an intimate relationship with a man.

Take care, and be safe out there.
Don’t settle.
You deserve only the best!

(Note: Women involved in same sex relationships also face challenges finding the right partner, but the  (DVRAA) Introduction: is specifically designed for women involved in a heterosexual relationship.)
